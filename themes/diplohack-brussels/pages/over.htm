            Networks and collaborations are becoming increasingly important; the world is changing, so is diplomacy. The rapid evolution of new technology in the 21st century offers both challenges and great opportunities. To meet these challenges, diplomats from the Netherlands and Sweden regularly collaborate with other actors to set up co-creative events that can approach issues of global relevance through ideation and design processes.
<br><br>
            #DiploHack combines the specific know-how and skill sets of diplomats, social entrepreneurs, tech developers and designers, along with that of journalists, academics, NGOs and businesses to ‘hack’ traditional diplomatic problems in start-up style groups.
