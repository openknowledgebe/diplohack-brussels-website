                Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free hackathon
                experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
                disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
                We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
                for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.
                <br><br>
                Diplohack participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion
                of the conference organisers. Our diplohack is focused on creating applications with Open Data in order to create
                more transparency on European decision making. We invite participants to help us with this challenge.

                Dutch Presidency of the Council of the EU, the Council of the EU and Open Knowledge Belgium are dedicated to
                providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
                Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
                orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
                <br><br>
                Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
                partners should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
                Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes,
                or otherwise create a sexualised environment. If a participant engages in harassing behavior,
                the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
                or expulsion from the diplohack. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
                or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
                <br><br>
                Diplohack organisers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement,
                provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the diplohack.
                We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at diplohhack and workshop venues
                and hackathon-related social events. Our diplohack is focused on creating applications with Open Data in order
                to create more transparency on European decision making. We invite participants to help us with this challenge
